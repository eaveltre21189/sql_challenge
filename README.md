## Data Modeling

I used QuickDBD to create an ERD and schema for my data tables
<br><br>

## Data Engineering

Using my QuickDBD schema as a basis, I created a SQL table schema to create the six data tables. Then, I manually imported the data into each table from the CSV files, using the Import/Export function in PGAdmin.

## Data Analysis

I created a series of SQL queries to complete the following:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
